# Uber MCP Server - TDD Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for the Uber MCP Server using Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices. Each feature will be implemented following the RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle.

## TDD Process for Each Feature
1. **RED**: Write failing tests first
2. **GREEN**: Write minimal code to make tests pass
3. **REFACTOR**: Improve code quality while keeping tests green
4. **VERIFY**: Run tests after each iteration

### Running Tests During Development
```bash
# Method 1: From within devenv shell
devenv shell
test  # Run this after each change

# Method 2: From outside the shell
devenv shell -c test
```

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure Improvements âœ“
- [x] Set up proper devenv configuration with all Python dependencies
- [x] Configure development tools (linting, formatting, type checking)
- [x] Verify all existing tests pass with 80%+ coverage

## Phase 2: Complete Placeholder Implementations
### 2.1 Kubernetes Port Forwarding Tool
- [ ] Write tests for port forwarding functionality
  - [ ] Test successful port forward setup
  - [ ] Test invalid pod/namespace handling
  - [ ] Test port conflict scenarios
  - [ ] Test cleanup on connection close
- [ ] Implement async port forwarding logic
- [ ] Add proper state management
- [ ] Document usage and limitations

### 2.2 OpenShift Routes Tool (if needed)
- [ ] Determine if Routes support is required
- [ ] If yes, write tests for CustomObjectsApi integration
- [ ] Implement Routes listing functionality
- [ ] If no, properly document why it's a placeholder

## Phase 3: Enhanced Kubernetes Tools
### 3.1 Add Filtering and Sorting
- [ ] Write tests for namespace filtering on all tools
- [ ] Write tests for label selector support
- [ ] Write tests for field selector support
- [ ] Implement filtering parameters
- [ ] Add sorting options (by name, creation time, etc.)

### 3.2 Add More Resource Types
- [ ] ConfigMaps Tool
  - [ ] Write tests for listing ConfigMaps
  - [ ] Implement ConfigMap listing
- [ ] StatefulSets Tool
  - [ ] Write tests for StatefulSet listing
  - [ ] Implement StatefulSet listing
- [ ] DaemonSets Tool
  - [ ] Write tests for DaemonSet listing
  - [ ] Implement DaemonSet listing
- [ ] Namespaces Tool
  - [ ] Write tests for namespace listing
  - [ ] Implement namespace listing

## Phase 4: Advanced Features
### 4.1 Resource Details Tools
- [ ] Write tests for getting individual resource details
- [ ] Implement GET endpoints for detailed resource info
- [ ] Add YAML/JSON output format options

### 4.2 Resource Watching/Streaming
- [ ] Write tests for watch functionality
- [ ] Implement WebSocket endpoints for real-time updates
- [ ] Add event streaming for resource changes

### 4.3 Multi-Cluster Support
- [ ] Write tests for multiple cluster configurations
- [ ] Implement cluster context switching
- [ ] Add cluster parameter to all tools

## Phase 5: Security and Production Readiness
### 5.1 Authentication & Authorization
- [ ] Write tests for API key authentication
- [ ] Write tests for JWT token validation
- [ ] Implement authentication middleware
- [ ] Add role-based access control (RBAC)

### 5.2 Rate Limiting & Monitoring
- [ ] Write tests for rate limiting
- [ ] Implement rate limiting middleware
- [ ] Add Prometheus metrics
- [ ] Add health check endpoints

### 5.3 Error Handling & Logging
- [ ] Write tests for comprehensive error scenarios
- [ ] Implement structured logging
- [ ] Add request ID tracking
- [ ] Improve error messages and status codes

## Phase 6: API Enhancements
### 6.1 OpenAPI/Swagger Documentation
- [ ] Write tests for API documentation
- [ ] Add OpenAPI schema generation
- [ ] Include interactive API documentation

### 6.2 Response Pagination
- [ ] Write tests for pagination
- [ ] Implement limit/offset parameters
- [ ] Add continuation token support

### 6.3 Response Caching
- [ ] Write tests for caching behavior
- [ ] Implement Redis-based caching
- [ ] Add cache invalidation logic

## Phase 7: DevOps and Deployment
### 7.1 Containerization
- [ ] Create Dockerfile
- [ ] Write tests for container builds
- [ ] Add multi-stage build optimization

### 7.2 Kubernetes Deployment
- [ ] Create Helm chart
- [ ] Write deployment manifests
- [ ] Add ConfigMap for configuration

### 7.3 CI/CD Pipeline
- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions
- [ ] Automate testing on PR
- [ ] Automate container builds
- [ ] Add security scanning

## Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual tool methods
2. **Integration Tests**: Test API endpoints with mocked K8s
3. **Contract Tests**: Verify API contracts
4. **Performance Tests**: Load testing for production readiness

## Success Metrics
- Maintain 80%+ test coverage at all times
- All tests must pass before merging
- Run tests after every implementation
- Use linting and type checking regularly
- Format code before commits

### Development Commands Quick Reference
```bash
# Enter development shell
devenv shell

# Inside the shell:
test          # Run tests with coverage
test-watch    # Run tests in watch mode
lint          # Run pylint
typecheck     # Run mypy
format        # Format code
check         # Run all checks
build         # Build package
clean         # Clean artifacts

# Or from outside:
devenv shell -c test
devenv shell -c check
devenv up     # Start server with auto-reload
```

## Notes
- Each checkbox represents a discrete task that should be completed with TDD
- Run tests after each task completion
- Update this document as tasks are completed
- Create detailed test cases before implementation
- Consider edge cases and error scenarios in tests
